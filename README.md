### Hi there, I'm Nic Butakow (he/him).
I'm a Bachelor's student in computer science and mathematics at the University of Florida. I'm currently working on [a research project](https://github.com/butakow/demographic-fairness) to determine whether gender bias exists in Tweets related to computer science education. Feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbutakow) or [email](mailto:nicholas@adastralab.com)!
