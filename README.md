### Hi there, I'm Nic Butakow (he/him).
I'm a Bachelor's student in computer science and mathematics at the University of Florida. I'm currently working on [a research project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1564480) to efficiently compute and search through a landscape of self-assembly configurations of symmetric molecules. Projects I've worked on are pinned to my profile. Feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbutakow) or [email](mailto:nicholas@adastralab.com)!
